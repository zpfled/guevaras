##website for 2Chez restaurant
[ pro-bono job ]

###overview

This was a collaboration with my good friend @davecrow. I was working at 2Chez Restaurant at the time, about to leave for Dev Bootcamp, and wanted to build something that would actually help somebody. 2Chez desperately needed a new website, so I started building it in Sinatra. Dave started helping me out with the front end, and taught me a lot about design and workflow along the way.

The 2Chez site is mobile-friendly, designed so that busy restaurant staff can quickly make changes to the online menu on the fly.
