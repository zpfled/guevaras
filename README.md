#website for 2Chez restaurant
[ freelance job ]

##overview

This was a collaboration with my good friend @davecrow. I was working at 2Chez Restaurant at the time, about to leave for Dev Bootcamp, and wanted to build something that would actually help somebody. 2Chez desperately needed a new website, so I started building it in Sinatra. Dave started helping me out with the front end, and taught me a lot about design and workflow along the way.
