Hi <%= admin.name.capitalize %>

You have removed <%= user.name.capitalize %>'s access to the 2Chez website. If you didn't mean to do this, too bad. You did it. But, you can easily just add them again. So do that if you need to.

If you have any questions, ask Zach, but he might charge you a free glass of whiskey in exchange for his help.

Sincerely,

The 2Chez Robot
